Description:
This script takes measurements from a Sharp IR range finder, and saves them on a file
The purpose of the script is to collect data to be utilized on a curve fitting
for the particular ranger in use

There will be a serial communication between the host computer and an arduino...
  the CurveFitting example will have to be uploaded on the arduino
You can print ruler_board.pdf to help you with the positioning of the object
You will need to find an object with a flat surface, dress it with a white paper,
and use it as the obstacle for the measurements
Upon completion, a file named 'datapoints.csv' will have been created
You will use this file on the curve_fitting.{m, py} script to do the fitting of the curve
It's only a matter of taste and availability whether you will use matlab or python

Input arguments for the script:
* port      - name of the serial port
* part_code - the name of the sensor { GP2D120XJ00F, GP2Y0A21YK, GP2Y0A02YK0F }
* step      - distance (in cm) between two successive measurements (1 or 2cm is recommended)
* nmpd      - number of measurements per distance (40 is recommended)

Example: python data_acquisition.py /dev/ttyACM0 GP2D120XJ00F 1 40

The script will make #(nmpd) measurements/distance for the #((r_max - r_min) / step + 1)
different distances of the object from the sensor
The script, prior to starting the measurements, will ask you to position the obstacle
to the appropriate distance, and then press Enter
