/**
 * This example is about the Sharp IR range finders
 * This example is supposed to be used in conjuction with the
 * data_acquisition.py script found here https://github.com/pAIgn10/SharpIRLib
 * As the first step, you're going to take some measurements with your sensor
 * Next, you will be utilize these data for fitting a curve for the
 * particular sensor in your possession
 *
 * Apparently not every sensor has the exact response indicated on the datasheet.
 * So, if you want a bit more accurate measurements, you can follow the instructions
 * on the data_acquisition and curve_fitting scripts to do a curve fitting on your sensor.
 *
 * Load this code on your arduino, and then go to
 * https://github.com/pAIgn10/SharpIRLib for more details
