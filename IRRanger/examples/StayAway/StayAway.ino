/**
 * A simple example showcasing the functionality of the library
 * If an object comes closer than a known threshold,
 * the onboard LED will lit and an indication will appear on the serial port
 *
 * Notes:
 * AREF: If your project uses an external voltage reference, then you should
 *       specify that reference voltage to the IRRanger instance with the setARef method
 * resetARef: Resets the reference to the default internal voltage level
 *            Please read this first -> http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogReference
 * Repeated measurements: You can set a number of successive measurements to be made
 *                        and then take their average as the final result. This might be
 *                        desirable since the sensor's output varies a bit.
 *                        Don't overdo it! For every additional measurement, a default
 *                        50ms delay is applied in order for the sensor to refresh.
 * Point of reference: If you want to find the distance of an object, not from
 *                     the sensor, but from another point of reference (perhaps the
 *                     center of your robot), then you can state the distance (in cm)
 *                     of the sensor from that point of interest either during the
 *                     initialization of an instance by supplying a third argument to
 *                     the constructor, or later with the setPRef method. From thereafter
 *                     this value will be getting added to every measurement you take.
 *                     This has a sensible meaning only when we are talking about 
 *                     units of length, and hence it will apply only when calling
 *                     methods getCM() and getIN().
